# docs contains my personal notes based on the code written in this repository

This directory contains my personal notes on this Nim/C++/.NET interop study, as well
as some of the references used to develop the code within this repository.

These have been primarily written to be of use to myself, but hopefully they will prove
useful to others as well.

## Table of Contents:

* [Nim compilation](nim_compilation_notes.md): Collection of some of the important 
    compile commands.
* [Nim c integration](nim_c_integration_notes.md): Statements required in Nim and C
    to ensure interop works as excepted.
* [Loading dlls dynamically](loading_dlls_dynamically_notes.md): How to load dlls 
    dynamically within C\# / .NET and reducing the performance impact of reflection.
* [Memory mapped files](memory_mapped_file_notes.md): How to use memory mapped files
