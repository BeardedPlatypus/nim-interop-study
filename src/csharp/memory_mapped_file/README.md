# `memory_mapped_file` contains a simple C\# implementation accessing a not-persistent memory mapped file

`MemoryMappedSimple` contains a simple implementation which loads the Nim DLL, creates
a memory mapped file accessing the data written by the Nim dll and writing it to the 
console.

The name of the not-persisted memory mapped file is defined in the `mapping.c` implementation.
